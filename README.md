# Old Blog with R Markdown

This project was the Capstone for the Google Data Analysis Certificate.

I thought I'd keep alive, but I didn't really. Today, I don't really code in R Markdown, which an obsolete technology.

I'm thinking about making a new `.github.io` blog with Quarto (which replaces R Mardown, although I'd use Python), so **I'm archiving this old project**.

I remember doing this project at my grandma's house, close to Paris. I was in the middle of my career transition, I went to visit her for her birthday. Then she sold the house were she lived most of her life, so many memories come to mind... I had a nice time... By the way, you probably don't care about it, I'm just archiving this.
